# Trojan Insertion Tool PCB Benchmarks
This repository contains PCB Trojan Benchmarks generated by TRIT_PCB.

The Benchmarks are in the form of KiCAD .net files. PCBNew software of KiCAD can be used convert the .net files into layout.
To convert to the appropriate layout please use the proper footprint libraries of the designs. The footprint libraries of the designs can be found at https://github.com/ciaa/Hardware. 
The Golden designs are from the following open source website: http://www.proyecto-ciaa.com.ar/index_en.html

More information regarding the Trojan structure and the designs can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12632.
